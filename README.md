# Build-an-e-commerce-store-with-Django
Django is an extremely popular open-source Python-based web framework, designed to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites with reusable pluggable components. Django has been famously used for sites such as Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, and Clubhouse.  In this workshop, we’ll deploy Django to create our own E-commerce storefront, which allows people to buy items with or without an account, combining the use of a database with cookies for anonymous usage. Aside from Django for the core functionality, we’ll use HTML/CSS/Javascript to improve our user experience as well as integrate with the PayPal API to handle purchase payments.  

Prerequisites: 
✅ Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
✅ Python (https://www.python.org/downloads)  
✅ PayPal developer account (https://developer.paypal.com/docs/get-started/)
